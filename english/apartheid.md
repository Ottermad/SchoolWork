'Out Of Bounds' is a collection of short stories, written by Berverely Naidoo, that explore the rise and fall of Apartheid.
Apartheid was a set of laws which were in place in South Africa from 1948 to 1994 which encouraged racism and imposed racial segregation.
Through her stories Naidoo shows how terrible Apartheid was and how people fought against it. I will explore how she conveys the horror of Apartheid in her stories: 'The Noose', 'One Day, Lily, One Day' and 'The Typewriter'.

One of things about Apartheid that made it so terrible was how it affected everyone - especially young children. To demonstrate how it affected children, Naidoo writes from the perspective of a child. In 'The Noose' she writes as a young coloured child, in 'One Day, Lily, One Day' she writes a six year old white girl and in 'The Typewriter' she writes as an eleven year old black girl.
To achieve a child's voice Naidoo has specifically altered both her vocabulary and the structure of her writing. A specific example of this is when in 'The Noose' with the use of the simile "We scarpered off faster than the Western Mail chased by a stream of Apaches". Here Naidoo makes reference to Cowboys and Indians, whom are commonly linked to young children. She also uses other items from a child's frame of reference such as comics and the Lone Ranger and words such as "mommy" which are frequently associated with children. 
By creating a child's voice she more effectively conveys the horror of Apartheid because people naturally feel more sympathy for children and the more sympathy for a character, the greater the horror of the challenges they face. 

Naidoo also shows Apartheid got progressively worse by gradually increasing the use of the violence from and against the government in each story.

In 'The Noose' there is little use of violence in relation to the Apartheid government and the only mention of violence from the government is when the police break up an anti-Apartheid meeting and attack some people with batons. 

However, in 'One Day, Lily, One Day', the amount of violence increases. It features an anti-Apartheid riot that concludes wit 



 it starts with the police arresting the father of the protagonist in a violent manner. She portrays the police as violent because through their description: "long coats and dark hats". Their description not only creates
