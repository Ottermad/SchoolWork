# Chapter About Courage in the Style of Harper Lee
## Charles Thomas

Under normal circumstances I despised school, however, in recent months it had become worse. Much worse. Since the information that Atticus was defending Tom Robinson had spread around the school, I had to be on constant lookout for the colourful variety of insults, and fists, that were hurled my way. I found the best way to my keep promise with Atticus to avoid fighting was to avoid people I could get into a fight with. But after the confrontation with the Ewells, I should have known that Monday would be the hardest day yet and I should have especially vigilant.

As Jem and I walked to school that morning, Jem seemed especially sombre as if he knew what was going to happen and kept a few paces behind me. Shortly before we arrived at school Jem pulled me aside and spoke to me in a hushed tone.

"Scout, keep your head down today."
"Why?" I asked, I thought Atticus would have reminded me if anything was going to happen.
"Something might happen today and I need you to promise me."
"What might happen today, Jem?"
"Just promise me, Scout." Jem insisted.
"Yes. I promise" I replied.

As I turned through the school gates, I felt my stomach churn, Jem's warning had put me on edge.

The day continued smoothly, I at my desk while my teacher held up flashcards and demand we repeat them. After, an hour of flashcards, the boredom at my desk while my teacher held up flashcards and demand we repeat them. After, an hour of flashcards, the boredom bought on by the Dewey Decimal System overtook my mind and I began to ponder Jem's warning. By lunchtime I still had not solved Jem's riddle like warning. 

I was walking home for lunch alone, my teacher had briefly held me behind for claiming that the flashcards where pointless. I had turned the corner and passed out of view of the school when I heard a voice yelling my name. Looking back I should have kept walking and ignored the voice. However, my curiosity got the better of me and I spun around.

Burris Ewell stood before me. He was even more disgusting that when I had last seen him; the truant officer dragged him on the first day of the year. His hair had become some kind of dungeon, continuously trapping dirt and grime and providing the perfect home for the cooties that nested there; his face had obviously not been washed for some time as most of his facial features had obstructed by the ever growing layer of mud; his clothes were the same ones as he had worn back in September, just more tattered and worn.

"Your father's helping a nigger." he spat at me.

I, who  was perfectly aware of that fact, struggled to find a response to Burris' statement and just held a blank look upon my face.

"My father says your father deserves to have watch is daughter suffer."

Even though I knew that he had repeated that from some older member of his family, I still felt my fists rising and my breaths becoming shorter. In an attempt to control my growing rage, I snarled back:

"What are you going to do?"

As I watched Burris process what I had said, a silence filled the air, the calm before a storm.

"I'm going to hurt you?" he said and his fist flew through the air.
